For UI related tasks always take context of `design-system.md`

Follow commands from ./.gemini/commands folder.

Whenever you are told to complete tasks from ./docs/tasks divide the md file into sub tasks and store in sub directory. Example:
for task1.md divide it as task1_1.md, task1_2.md, etc in task1_subtasks directory inside tasks directory.
